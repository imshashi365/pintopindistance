            Why Distance Between Pincodes Matters for e-Way Bill
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The e-Way Bill system under GST was introduced to ensure seamless and regulated movement of goods across state lines in India. One of the mandatory fields in the e-Way Bill is the distance between the supplier's and the recipient's location, which must be specified in kilometers. This distance affects the validity of the e-Way Bill and helps in verifying the genuineness of transportation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Accurate distance ensures that transporters do not misuse the system by claiming inappropriate transit durations or claiming GST credits incorrectly. According to GST guidelines, you are allowed a 10% deviation from the system-generated pincode distance, which gives some flexibility. However, continuous deviation without justification can attract scrutiny from the department.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Therefore, using a reliable tool that gives you the correct driving distance between two PIN codes is crucial to remain compliant. It helps avoid penalties, ensures timely delivery of goods, and maintains transparency in tax reporting.
